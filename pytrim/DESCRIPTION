Description: The pytrim package provides two essential functions for working with numeric data. The pythag function calculates the length of the third side of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. It includes error checking to ensure valid inputs, making it a valuable tool for geometry and trigonometry calculations. The trimmed_mean function calculates the trimmed mean of a numeric vector. It removes the smallest s values and the largest l values from the vector, providing a robust measure of central tendency.
